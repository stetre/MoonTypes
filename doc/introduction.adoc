== Introduction

MoonTypes is a library that provides means to define **C-like structured types** in Lua,
to instantiate them, and set/get fields from type instances.

It has been designed for the definition of message formats - specifically, for signals
exchanged by https://github.com/stetre/moonagents[MoonAgents'] agents -
but it is a standalone library and can be as well used as a general purpose type system.

Types in MoonTypes are defined in one or more <<groups, groups>>. This allows, for
example, to define different message interfaces and keep their type definitions separate.

The definition of types is done according to a <<syntax, syntax>> that is very similar to
that for type declaration in the C programming language, and that supports structs, arrays,
and unions.

Once a group is populated with type definitions, <<instances, instances>> of its type can
be created and their fields can be accessed using a convenient <<fieldname, dot notation>>.
