== Primitive types

A MoonTypes <<group, group>>, when created, has the following primitive types
pre-defined in it:

* Lua's native http://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/manual.html#2.1[basic types] with the exception of *nil*,
* the *void* type (a type having no values),
* a few constrained numeric types (*bit*, *char*, *short*, *int*, etc.), and
* the *bitstr* and *hexstr* types (strings representing binary and hexadecimal data).

Beware that fields of the Lua types *table*, *function*, *thread*, and *userdata* are stored
in instances by reference.

The table below contains the full list of pre-defined primitive types, together with a description of the values they admit.

|*bit* | 1 
| a Lua _number_ that can be either 0 or 1
|*char* | 1

|*ushort* | 1 
| any Lua _number_ representing a 16-bit unsigned integer (0 &#8804; _x_ &#8804; 2^16^-1)
|*int* | 1 
| any Lua _number_ representing a 32-bit signed integer (-2^31^ &#8804; _x_ &#8804; 2^31^-1)
|*uint* | 1 
| any Lua _number_ representing a 32-bit unsigned integer (0 &#8804; _x_ &#8804; 2^32^-1)
|*long* | 1 
| any Lua _number_ representing a 64-bit signed integer (-2^63^ &#8804; _x_ &#8804; 2^63^-1)
|*ulong* | 1 
| any Lua _number_ representing a 64-bit unsigned integer (0 &#8804; _x_ &#8804; 2^64^-1)
|*float* | 1 | any Lua _number_ representing a single precision floating point
|*double* | 1 | any Lua _number_ (representing a double precision floating point)
|*bitstr* | 1 
| any Lua _string_ containing only the characters '0' and '1'
|*hexstr* | 1 
| any Lua _string_, of even length, containing only characters from 
the ranges '0-9', 'a-f' and 'A-F'
|===

Additional primitive types may be added to a group using the following method, prior to
parsing the type definition strings or files that use them:

[[primitive]]
* _group_++:++*primitive*(_name_, _checkfunc_) +
[small]#Defines an additional primitive type named _name_ (a string). The _checkfunc_ argument
must be a function accepting a value and returning _true_ if it is a valid value for the newly
defined type, or _false_ otherwise.#

.Example: a custom primitive type
[source, lua]
----
local group = types.group()
-- Define a primitive type named 'mynumber', constrained between 0 and 1 inclusive
group:primitive("mynumber", function(x) return type(x)=="number" and x>=0 and x<=1)
----
